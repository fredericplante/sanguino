Sanguino
===============================================================================

Summary:
Sanguino is a port of the Arduino core to work with the atmega644p and 
atmega1284p chips.  It is meant to work with the corresponding version of 
Arduino which is it ported for.

Install:
  * First download the corresponding version of Arduino, this should match the 
    Sanguino version, i.e.: Sanguino0023r4 would use Arduino 0023, and 
    Sanguino0101r1 would use Arduino 1.0.1.

  * Unzip ( or pull from repo ) Sanguino

  * Copy the 'sanguino' directory into Arduino's 'hardware' directory.  
    i.e.: arduino-1.0.1/hardware/ 

  * Arduino should now show the atmega644p and atmega1284p boards.

Source:
  The default project repository will track all version 1.0 and greater, if 
  you are looking for pre 1.0 code it is in the legacy repository.
